## Prerequisites

The Agents extension depends on the Salesforce Extension Pack.

Prior to using the Agents extension, install the [Salesforce Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode) and its prerequisites.

This extension also depends on the agents plugin for the salesforce CLI (`sf`). Install it by running

```bash
sf plugins install @salesforce/plugin-agent
```
